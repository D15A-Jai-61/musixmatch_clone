# musixmatch_clone

A GUI and functional clone of the Musixmatch app on Google Play Store. I have implemented YouTube search for music, YouTube trending songs page, local music library display and Google Firebase Firestore features.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Bulk commit issue

I forgot to commit changes while heavily invested in the project, and therefore from Basic GUI to almost full completion, all changes are in one commit.
