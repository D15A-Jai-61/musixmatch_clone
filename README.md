# musixmatch_clone

A GUI and functional clone of the Musixmatch app on Google Play Store. I have implemented YouTube search for music, YouTube trending songs page, local music library display and Google Firebase Firestore features.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## No API keys in the code, and proper way to store the Keys not implemented

You will have to add your own API keys, and hardcode them, or implement a way to securely store those keys.

## Existing features

1. YouTube trending songs feature (Add your own key)
2. YouTube search feature (Add your own key and corresponding URL)
3. Google Firebase Firestore integration (Add your own key)
4. Buttons that open a web-page in the system default browser (All buttons and links redirect to Musixmatch)
5. Chrome Web View (Or any WebView depending on your system configuration)
6. Local storage music library
7. Picture-in-Picture mode
8. Music recognition (Add your own key)

## Features to improve or add

1. Implement a secure and proper way to store API keys
2. Implement saving history for the music recognition feature
3. Implement storage of images in a database from the Profile page
4. Fix UI overflow in PiP mode
5. Add a functionality to search for lyrics and to display them
6. Add a functionality to display lyrics on top of other apps using the PiP mode

## Copyrighted content

The images used in the project have been directly screenshotted from the official Musixmatch app, and I don't know if they are copyrighted or not, however, I recommend that you don't use these pictures if you plan on distributing this codebase.
